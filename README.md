# NextGenHelloWorld
Taking the tradition of printing Hello World! to the next level, we have decided to make a NextGenHelloWorld :)

      This code keeps on printing Hello World in the time delay mentioned by the user     
      
      The delay between each console output is 1 second    
      
      At the time of execution of the code, the user may enter "Stop" (witthout quotes) on the console to stop the process 
      The above mentioned is implemented by running input and
      output tasks on different threads and handling events
      independent of others.
